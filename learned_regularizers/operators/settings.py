"""
Here, we define the forward operators, noise levels and data-fidelity terms used in the experiments of the chapter.
We provide two functions:
For training, we use the get_operator function which returns the physics and data fidelity term.
For evaluation, we use the get_evaluation_setting function which additionally returns the test dataset.
